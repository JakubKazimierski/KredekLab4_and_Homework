This program is simulating simple FBI database.

Using entity framework, and code first rule
I created database with 5 tables:

		>FBIagentsList 
			-it is simply table with data of normal FBI agents	
			-contains Foreign Key to table FBIagentsTypes

		>FBIagentsTypes
			-table contains information about types of agents

		>FBIcriminalsList
			-table contains FBI data about criminals
			-contains Foreign Key to table FBIcriminalsType
		
		>FBIcriminalsTypes 
			-table contains infromation about types of criminals

		>FBIundercoverAgents
			-table contains list of agents who are udercover criminals
			-contains foreign key to table FBIcriminalsList

Whole data base has made in .NET Graphic IDE, personally i think it's look quite nice
though it is quite simple.
